const date = new Date();

const options = {

  day: 'numeric',
  date : "numeric",
  hour : "numeric",
  minute : "numeric",
};


- `year`: Specifies how the year should be displayed in the formatted date. The value `"numeric"` indicates that the year should be displayed as a number.
  
- `month`: Specifies how the month should be displayed in the formatted date. The value `"long"` indicates that the full name of the month should be displayed.

- `day`: Specifies how the day should be displayed in the formatted date. The value `"numeric"` indicates that the day should be displayed as a number.

- `hour`: Specifies how the hour should be displayed in the formatted date. The value `"numeric"` indicates that the hour should be displayed as a number.

These options are used when formatting a date using the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` object in JavaScript. For example, if you were to format a date using these options, you might get a result like: "May 25, 2024 12:30".

const frDate = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('fr-FR', options);
frDate = format(date);

console.log(frDate);
